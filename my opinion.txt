My Opinion.

You should fix API for getting all data.
	
	As i showed you yesterday, to get all data, i should send several request.
	So to get data(to load page) is taking few time. This can't be ignored.
	In my think, this is issue.
	(If my method is wrong, please point my fault.)
	I don't know well that this API is built for other function, but for this page is not suitable.
	So this API should be fixed so that get data with one request.

	If you can't understand(Of course i think you understood), I hope to meet back-end developer and discuss in details with him.
